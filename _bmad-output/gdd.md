# Escape from Piggy - Game Design Document

**Author:** neo
**Date:** 2026-01-10
**Game Type:** Metroidvania / Precision Platformer

## Executive Summary

### Game Name

**Escape from Piggy**

### Core Concept

Escape from Piggy is a Celeste-inspired precision platformer set in İzmir Institute of Technology (IZTECH), where players control Rector Yusuf Baran as he navigates through five parallel universe versions of campus to escape from wild boars using DNA-based superpowers.

This is a love letter to the IZTECH community wrapped in brutally challenging but fair platforming. Players will master tight Celeste-style movement controls (jump, dash, wall-climb) while collecting DNA from boars and the environment to unlock increasingly absurd biological abilities - from laser eyes that break walls, to vampire form for wall-running, to piggy riding. The game celebrates local Turkish university culture while delivering a precision platformer experience that stands alongside Celeste and Super Meat Boy.

Each of the five parallel universes offers distinct visual identity and atmosphere: Normal IZTECH (realistic campus), Bio-Punk IZTECH (nature-reclaimed bioluminescence), Retro-Tech IZTECH (80s vaporwave wireframes), Cosmic Horror IZTECH (eldritch void geometry), and Mirror IZTECH (crystalline convergence). This structure provides visual variety rare in the genre while maintaining the tight, responsive controls that define great precision platformers.

The DNA manipulation system adds strategic depth beyond typical power-ups. Players choose which abilities to unlock at Bio-Stations, enabling metroidvania-style backtracking to previously inaccessible secrets. Combined with accessibility features inspired by Celeste's assist mode, the game ensures both hardcore challenge seekers and casual players can experience the humor and cultural celebration at its heart.

### Game Type

**Type:** Metroidvania

**Framework:** This GDD uses the metroidvania template with type-specific sections for interconnected world design, ability gating, exploration rewards, and backtracking mechanics. While the core gameplay is precision platforming (like Celeste), the DNA ability system and world structure create metroidvania progression - new abilities open previously blocked areas, encouraging exploration and rewarding curiosity with secrets, optional challenges, and faster progression through bonus DNA.
